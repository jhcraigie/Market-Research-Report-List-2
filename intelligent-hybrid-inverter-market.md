<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Hybrid Inverter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Inverter</li><li>Three-Phase Inverter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intelligent hybrid inverters are widely categorized into two main types: single-phase inverters and three-phase inverters. Single-phase inverters are designed to convert direct current (DC) power from solar panels into alternating current (AC) power for use in residential or small commercial applications. On the other hand, three-phase inverters are more suitable for larger commercial or industrial setups that require higher power output and efficiency. Both types of inverters incorporate intelligent features to optimize energy production and storage.</p></p>
