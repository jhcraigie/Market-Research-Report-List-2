<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Top Type</li><li>M Type</li><li>Ring Type</li><li>Spiral Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beam converters are devices used in laser systems to shape the beam output. Four common types include Flat Top Type, M Type, Ring Type, and Spiral Type. Flat Top Type creates a flat-top beam profile for uniform intensity distribution. M Type produces a Gaussian-shaped beam with a central high-intensity peak. Ring Type generates a ring-shaped beam with a dark center. Spiral Type creates a spiral-shaped beam pattern. Each type caters to specific laser applications, offering different beam shapes and intensity distributions.</p></p>
