<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manoeuvring Thrusters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tunnel Thrusters</li><li>Waterjet Bow Thrusters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manoeuvring thrusters are essential for enhancing the maneuverability of ships and vessels. Two common types in the market are tunnel thrusters and waterjet bow thrusters. Tunnel thrusters are mounted horizontally through the hull of the ship and provide lateral thrust for improved maneuvering in tight spaces. Waterjet bow thrusters, on the other hand, use high-pressure water jets to enable precise control and efficient maneuvering at the bow of the vessel. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient navigation of ships.</p></p>
