<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression release brake and exhaust brake are both types of engine brakes used in vehicles to slow down the vehicle without using the traditional braking system. A compression release brake works by releasing pressure in the cylinders during the exhaust stroke, creating resistance that slows down the engine. On the other hand, an exhaust brake restricts the flow of exhaust gases, creating back pressure that slows down the vehicle. Both types of engine brakes are effective in reducing wear on the traditional braking system and increasing overall vehicle safety.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Engine Brake Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Below 11 MT</li><li>11-15 MT</li><li>Above 15 MT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engine brake market application varies based on the weight class of the vehicles. Below 11 MT vehicles typically have smaller engines and are more fuel-efficient, making engine brakes less essential. 11-15 MT vehicles are medium-duty trucks that benefit from engine brakes for better control and decreased wear on the braking system. Trucks above 15 MT are heavy-duty vehicles that require powerful engine brakes for improved safety and handling on steep terrains. Overall, engine brakes play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and safety of vehicles across different weight classes.</p></p>
