<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Solar Thermal</li><li>Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar thermal technologies can be classified into two main types: Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) and Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal (NCST) systems. CST systems concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses onto a small area to generate high temperatures, which are then used for various applications such as electricity generation or heating. NCST systems, on the other hand, directly absorb sunlight without concentration and convert it into heat for heating or hot water purposes. Both types have their own advantages and applications in the solar thermal market.</p></p>
