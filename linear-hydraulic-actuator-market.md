<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Hydraulic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting</li><li>Double-Acting</li><li>Double-Rod</li><li>Rodless</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear hydraulic actuators are commonly classified into different types based on their design and functionality. Single-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend the piston rod in one direction, while double-acting actuators are capable of operating in both directions. Double-rod actuators have two piston rods for increased stability and load capacity. Rodless actuators do not have a traditional piston rod, allowing for a compact design and smoother operation. Other types of linear hydraulic actuators include telescoping, tandem, and multi-stage actuators, each designed for specific applications and requirements.</p></p>
