<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydroxyisobutyric Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>50% HBA Solution</li><li>98% HBA Solution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (HBA) is available in two main market types: 50% HBA Solution and 98% HBA Solution. The 50% HBA Solution is a diluted form of the acid, with half of its concentration being HBA. This type is generally used in applications where a lower concentration of HBA is required. On the other hand, the 98% HBA Solution is a more concentrated form, suitable for applications where a higher purity of HBA is essential. Both market types cater to different needs within the industry.</p></p>
