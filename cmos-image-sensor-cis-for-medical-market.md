<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor CIS for Medical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) technology is crucial in medical imaging applications, with two main types available in the market: Rolling Shutter and Global Shutter. Rolling Shutter sensors capture images by sweeping across the sensor line by line, which can lead to distortion when capturing moving objects. In contrast, Global Shutter sensors capture the entire image at once, making them better suited for capturing fast-moving objects with higher accuracy. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various medical imaging devices based on specific requirements.</p></p>
