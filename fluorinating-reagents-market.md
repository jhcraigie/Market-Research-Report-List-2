<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorinating Reagents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents</li><li>Nucleophilic Fluorinating Reagents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorinating reagents can be broadly categorized into two types: electrophilic and nucleophilic fluorinating reagents. Electrophilic fluorinating reagents are electron-deficient species that are attracted to electron-rich sites in organic molecules, leading to the introduction of fluorine atoms. On the other hand, nucleophilic fluorinating reagents are electron-rich species that donate electrons to electron-deficient sites in organic molecules, resulting in the formation of carbon-fluorine bonds. Both types of fluorinating reagents play important roles in the synthesis of fluorinated compounds.</p></p>
