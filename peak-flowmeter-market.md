<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peak Flowmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronic Meter</li><li>Mechanical Meter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peak flowmeters are devices used to measure the maximum airflow that can be achieved during a forced breath. There are two main types of peak flowmeters: electronic meters and mechanical meters. Electronic meters use sensors to measure airflow and display the results digitally, while mechanical meters use a spring mechanism to measure airflow and display results on a scale. Both types of peak flowmeters are widely used in clinical settings to monitor respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD.</p></p>
