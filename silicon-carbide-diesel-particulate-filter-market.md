<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Carbide Diesel Particulate Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Pssive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active silicon carbide diesel particulate filters use a fuel additive to lower the combustion temperature of trapped soot particles, allowing for more efficient regeneration. Passive filters, on the other hand, rely solely on the exhaust gas temperature to burn off accumulated soot. Active filters tend to be more effective at reducing emissions but require ongoing maintenance, while passive filters are simpler in design but may not be as efficient in reducing particulate matter. Both types play a crucial role in reducing harmful emissions from diesel engines.</p></p>
