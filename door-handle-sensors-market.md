<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Door Handle Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Button Type</li><li>Induction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Door handle sensors come in two main types: button type and induction type. Button type sensors require the user to push a physical button to activate the handle, while induction type sensors automatically detect the user's presence and open the door without any physical contact. The button type sensors are more commonly found in commercial settings where security is a concern, while induction type sensors are popular in residential buildings for their convenience and touchless operation. Both types offer different advantages depending on the specific needs of the user.</p></p>
