<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mercury Removal Carbon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powdery</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mercury removal carbon is used in two different market types: powdery and granular. In the powdery market, the carbon is finely ground into a powder form, which allows for a larger surface area and better adsorption of mercury molecules. This makes it ideal for applications where a high level of mercury removal is required. On the other hand, in the granular market, the carbon is formed into granules, making it easier to handle and transport. Granular carbon is typically used in smaller-scale applications where a compact and convenient form of carbon is needed.</p></p>
