<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Polishing Materials for Silicon Wafer Fabrication Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMP Slurry</li><li>CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) materials are essential for the fabrication of silicon wafers used in semiconductor manufacturing. Two key components of the CMP process are CMP slurry and CMP pads. CMP slurry is a mixture of abrasives, chemicals, and additives that helps remove material from the wafer surface during polishing. CMP pads are the physical interface between the wafer and the polishing equipment, providing the necessary pressure and friction for the polishing process. Both CMP slurry and CMP pads play crucial roles in achieving the desired smoothness and flatness of silicon wafers.</p></p>
