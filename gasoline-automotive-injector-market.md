<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gasoline Automotive Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Port Fuel Injection</li><li>Direct Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gasoline automotive injectors play a crucial role in the fuel delivery system of vehicles. There are two main types of injectors: Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Direct Injection (DI). PFI injects fuel into the intake ports located near the engine cylinders, while DI injects fuel directly into the combustion chamber. PFI is commonly found in older vehicles and provides good fuel atomization and mixing. On the other hand, DI is more efficient and offers better fuel economy and performance by delivering precise amounts of fuel directly to the combustion chamber.</p></p>
